					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<span class="byline">Meet the six team members that make up Team 15</span>
				</div>
				<p>A short bio on each member of the team, including our interest in I.T., along with links to our individual GitHub pages.<br>
				<p><b><a href="https://annalee5.github.io/Assignment1/" target=blank>Anna Lee</b></a> - I am Melbourne born and bred, but I am of Chinese heritage. Before Covid stopped the world, I was a Marketing Manager for a hospitality group, of which I really loved doing because of my passion for food and wine. With plenty of unforeseen spare time up my sleeve due to the pandemic, I have been keeping myself busy reading (definitely want to learn more about Cosmology in particular), knitting (currently attempting a sweater), going for bike rides (damn you steep inclines!) and learning the basics of HTML/CSS. After having some time on my hands this year, I started learning HTML/CSS basics and really found myself enjoying it. This sparked an idea to take my learning to a more formal setting, which is how I got into this course. I’m very excited to see what potential this can bring, both personally and professionally! Student ID: s3875109</p>
				<p> * </p>
				<p><b><a href="https://christopher-grant.github.io/IIT/" target=blank>Christopher Grant</b></a> -  I am a 38-year-old male born in Melbourne, Australia. I left high school after Year 10 to work full time in the retail industry. I have a cert. II in Retail Operations and have completed a few introductory short courses in programming including Python & SQL. I am currently an Operations Manager in a printing & point of sale company in Melbourne’s SE. In my spare time, I like to get outside and go for a hike, snowboard or even just take my dogs for a walk. The interest I have in IT comes from my childhood, specifically my father. For many years my father would show me the basics of tinkering with electronics, how to read wiring diagrams, and we would often design, create and build small projects using components like 555 timers, etc. During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn how to undertake tasks like web design, data management and analyses, software development and cloud computing to help further my career. Student ID: s3879459</p>
				<p> * </p>
				<p><b><a href="https://jagreig333.github.io/JamesProjects/" target=blank>James Greig</b></a> - I was born in New Zealand, now living in Perth, WA. I was previously studying Bachelor of Applied Sciences at RMIT and am looking at transferring to Bachelor of IT, so I am doing two units this semester to test the waters. So far I am very much enjoying it. My interests are varied – permaculture, brewing/distilling, philosophy, guitar, martial arts.  I live with my beautiful partner, my stepdaughter, our dog, 3 cats, and 2 pink and grey galahs.
					My particular interests in IT are Programming and Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is probably the greatest of these interests. I chose RMIT because it has a good reputation for IT, and also it was the best option available via Open Universities Australia. I expect to learn through this degree (and probably Graduate Certificates/Masters ) a skill set that will give me access to work in the IT industry, working in Cyber Security. Student ID: s3804106</p>
<p> * </p>
<p><b><a href="https://nietcat.github.io/RMITIntro/" target=blank>Michelle May</b></a> - I am a proud Australian Aboriginal woman. I have a Diploma of Project Management and have studied linguistics and philosophy. I have worked primarily in the digital space beginning with website and intranet management. I have moved onto working with businesses in projects and change management roles to identify and bring to life digital opportunities. I usually act as the intermediary between IT and the business. My interest in IT resonates with making services, especially government, easier, cheaper and better for ordinary people. I believe technology benefits should be available to everyone. I have a special interest in human centred design and the Digital Service Standard. I chose RMIT as it has a strong reputation as a university for Information Technology studies, studying through OUA for flexibility. I expect my studies to lead to a better understanding of different specialist roles and services to communicate and use them better to build valuable and robust services. Student ID: s3879582</p>
	<p> * </p>
	<p><b><a href="https://rebeccadaimol.github.io/IIT/" target=blank>Rebecca Daimol</b></a> - I am a Papua New Guinean living in South Australia with my partner and children. I speak English and New Guinea Pidgin but also understand the language native to my Mother’s island home; PNG itself has over 850 different languages. I grew up and eventually worked on Lihir Island, which is 3 degrees south of the equator. Lihir hosts a gold mining operation in a dormant volcano and operations face the challenge of working with geothermal activity. My decision to pursue IT was influenced by my experience during the peak of COVID19 in cases in South Australia in April 2020. I home-schooled my children for a month and realised that even my primary school-aged children have a dependency on IT. This sparked my interest in the industry and prompted me to consider their security. Through this degree pathway, I expect to develop the theoretical knowledge and practical experience necessary to begin a career in the IT industry. I look forward to the insights into Information Technology that make it the ever-evolving phenomena that it is. There is also an emphasis on communications and social interactions, that reminds us of the human component, I believe this will prepare me for the professional environment. Student ID: s3875198</p>

	<p><b><a href="https://shevlyn.github.io/MY-PROFILE-A1/personalinformation.html" target=blank>Shevlyn Maharaj</b></a> - I am a Fijian Indian. I have completed Year 10, currently halfway through year 11 but I have enrolled in University. An interesting fact is that I do MMA, Muay This and Boxing. I also have a 1 year old German Shepherd. Growing up in this day and age, I have been exposed to information technology on a daily basis in some way, which lead me to solve virtual technology related problems in my surroundings and therefore always having interest in IT. Although, I have not yet decided on a specific desired job, working alongside government agencies as well as having other IT jobs definitely interests me. Student ID: s3871451</p>

								<h2>Personality Tests</h2>
								<span class="byline">Results from our three personality tests</span>
							</div>
							<p>For an indepth analysis of our individual three personality test results, we encourage you to visit our individual GitHub pages.<br>
							The analysis below will be based on us as a group, and how our personality traits affect our ability to work collaboratively together.<br>
							The only test all six members took was the Myers-Briggs test, which explains why some of the test results only show five participants.</p>
							<br>

							<p><img src="big5.png" height="70%" width="70%">.</p>
							<p><img src="myersbriggs.png" height="35%" width="35%">.</p><br>


							<p>The results were interesting to see for the three personality tests, especially having two INTJ-A (Myers-Briggs) members! What are the chances?</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>What’s great to see though, is that our group has a great mix of all personality traits. With the Myers-Briggs test results - of the six members, there are four extroverts vs. two introverts; four intuitive vs. two observant; four thinking vs. two feeling; three prospective vs. three judging. The only notable difference was having five assertive personality traits compared to one turbulent.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>It’s good to see that we are not leaning too one way over the other, so we can all bring different styles of thinking and communicating. This can only be a positive within our group dynamic, as we see this as a very well rounded group!</p>
<br>
							<p><img src="learningstyles.png" height="40%" width="40%">.</p>

							<p>An interesting way to present the Learning Styles data of our group, was to show what the average of our results were for this test. Overall, when averaging out our scores, the group learns predominantly through a Pragmatic style. Almost all members, except for one, rated highest in a Pragmatic learning style, at an average of 33%.
								This will mean the group will primarily learn in a practical fashion, preferring to put into practice the tasks at hand, over visualising abstract concepts and ideas. Lengthy discussions and debates will likely result in us losing focus or concentration, which means that the group as a whole will make quick decisions and get to work, which is fantastic for a group project.<br>
							The lowest average was in the Reflector learning style, with an average of 19%. Reflector learning style has a penchant for taking a step back and observing, with a cautious approaching to learning. Whilst it may sound counterproductive for a group project on limiting timing, as a group we have to be careful that we don't miss any vital details or forget the bigger picture through our haste.</p>

									<h2>Group Reflection</h2><br>
									<p>Working as a group always has its inherent issues, whether it’s in a University course setting or at a workplace environment. It is important to say that the group experience with the assignment has many similarities to team work in real work scenarios.
								Through our team meetings it is evident that we have embraced everyone’s professional backgrounds and personal interests. We have also managed to be flexible, through a level of understanding, catering to each other’s commitments. The way in which we have delegated work for the contribution to the body of the assignment reflects these considerations. We were all honest about our individual strengths and weaknesses and we each volunteered for the portions of the assignment that we thought we could best contribute. </p>
                <p>Setting up our group GitHub for this assignment proved a little more of a challenge than expected. Well, not so much the creating the account but configuring the existing app. Both Anna and Chris experienced branching errors when trying to commit to GitHub for the first time. After re-configuring our GitHub apps and Atom editors to look for 'master' branch instead of 'main' branch we were all set.</p>
								<p>It was fantastic to see group members offering suggestions of improvement and helped each other out when needed throughout the process. There was no “you’re on your own” mentality. <br>
								One element that we found surprising me was how well we all got along from the start, even though we are all in different parts of the countries, a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences, and had never met before. It was pleasant from the first meeting, and we did not expect this. We assumed there would be some time before we all felt comfortable around each other. Everyone was also very understanding with each other’s strengths and short-comings, and gravitated to their natural aptitude and apparent preference for work type.</p>
								<p>Another surprising element was we found that through camaraderie and mutual dependence to complete the assignment, we found this created more discipline and accountability, but also more pressure to deliver. We would be less likely to stretch so far beyond our own experience and knowledge if we were doing the assignments alone. A group assignment really challenges you in aspects that you don’t realise, and makes you think more broadly, so we found we really enjoyed this element of our course. </p>

									<h3>Individual Reflection</h3><br>
									<p><b>Anna</b> - Surprisingly, I found this group experience to be as cohesive as a group can get. Every member bought their experience, their knowledge and their thoughts and opinions on how the group and the workload should run. As there was quick decision making, this resulted in us being able to use our time effectively to focus on the work at hand. This was immediate from the start, which meant we could accomplish this assignment within the timeframe and without the need to feel pressured to produce subpar work.<br>
										Some of the difficulties we experienced was perhaps being a group of the larger side, with six members, meant that the coordination of meetings took some time to work out. Not all members could make each meeting, however this is not too dissimilar to a workplace, and what really helped in this case was the use of the meeting agendas, post meeting notes and recordings. This meant any member who could not make the meeting, could easily catch up on our discussions. As we met twice a week, this meant the ability to catch up was easily done, as opposed to if we met once a week for a lengthier amount of time. <br>
										Overall, I believe we all performed very well collectively as a group on this assignment. We all contributed a unique perspective and skillset and we all came to understand each other relatively quickly too. I look forward to working together again on the next assignment. </p>
									<p><b>Christopher</b> - Working as a team of 6 members has been a great experience for this project. Everyone has brought a variety of experiences and knowledge to the group, making this experience a very pleasant one. In the beginning there was a bit of back and forth to get our first meeting and agenda set, but once we had locked in a day and time scheduling meetings seemed to flow better. Assigning tasks and working from a spreadsheet we could all access was fantastic. With tasks assigned to specific people, I believe there was a real mindset of ‘I need to get this done as not to let down my fellow team members’. <br>
										Looking at the technology side of the group, we at first had a few platform working at once. They were: Discord, email, MS Teams and GitHub. I found keeping everything like files and documents together in MS Teams and GitHub, and general coms chat in MS Teams and on email the best (and transparent) means of team activity. Looking specifically at MS Teams, I think that this software (out of four mentioned earlier) was a key platform for the success of our teams and our assignment.</p>
										<p><b>James</b> - I found that this group flowed very well. I have had a series of personal issues this Semester, if I hadn’t committed to this group work, I probably would have dropped out.  A few things can be improved, like confirming times for meetings regularly (which we became proficient at, eventually), checking correct times re: AEST/AWST (me), setting alarms for meetings ACTUAL times (me), and perhaps more regular meetings or active group chats to check in with each other (having teams on my phone made this so much easier). It was surprising how well it flowed together. Was also surprising at how kind and understanding everyone is. I have learned from this that group work isn’t always as bad as I expect it to be, and I should take a more positive minded approach to further teamwork and be less of a lone wolf. </p>
										<p><b>Michelle</b> - Firstly I think it is important to say that the group experience with the assignment has many similarities to team work in real work scenarios. Advantages include the ability to do more work over more areas than anyone is able to do alone, the ability to tap people’s different expertise and work preferences, and the opportunity to learn from others. Disadvantages include the difficulty of coordinating meeting and contribution times, although in a work environment this is normally countered by having set work hours versus the vastly varying schedules of distance education students.<br>
											Regardless of external pressures a single person cannot rely on last minute ‘all nighters’ or extension requests to get the assignment completed, this is a group effort. I am enjoying working with people with vastly different interests to my own, particularly with security and some of the new technologies. It is leading me to learn and look into areas I would probably otherwise gloss over and it will be an interesting challenge to do the project assignment with technology that I have no experience with.</P>
										<p><b>Rebecca</b> -Our team members have all expressed a genuine interest in this course, as well as working together with our elected group. I am not the most social individual however I was surprised by the ease in which our group formed and organised ourselves. Our individual project ideas are reflective of how diverse our interests are and yet we are all excited to collaborate and learn about the technology behind our project idea and its prospects.
											Our focus throughout this assignment was to establish an open line of communication and understanding while we worked towards completing our individual tasks. Moving forward, I hope to see us expand on our use of compulsory tools such as MS Teams, and make more use of other available applications.<br>
											Despite this, I have learned that with clear goals and delegation everyone involved feels a sense of responsibility and ownership. It is also quite motivating working with individuals who display qualities that you need to improve on, I personally aim to improve on my personal work ethic as a result. <br>
						Overall, what a wonderful group of people and it has been a pleasure working with Anna, Michelle, Christopher, James and Shevlyn.</p>


										<p><b>Shevlyn</b> -Developing this assessment was definitely a fun an amazing learning experience. Producing work in a group meant involvement of all members and work being divided, this is where I think our group did well in managing our assigned components of the assessment. Group meetings made it easier to communicate with different personalities who know so much and their different interests and knowledge enables us to learn so much from each other. It was somewhat difficult to attend all meetings this may be due to timing differences and other commitments. However, our group certainly exhibit skills of management and organisation.  I’m happy that everyone still knew their responsibilities and managed to complete the required task. I think communication is the most important factor in group progression. I may have lacked some effective communication, but regardless our group was very open and demonstrated support, everyone had their chance to speak. At the beginning of the assessment, I initially thought that we may have delayed our starting time while we were still figuring out the work and introducing ourselves, but we ultimately got what we had to accomplish on time. </p>
