					<h2>Interview with an I.T. professional</h2>
					<span class="byline">We invited Edward Xi from Planit to chat to us about his work as a Cybersecurity consultant.<br>
					Our interview with Edward took place on Thursday 15th October, 2020.</span>
				</div>
				<h3>Summary</h3><br>
				<p><b>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</b></p>
				<p>As a security consultant Edward had to be adept at assessing systems, ethical hacking, penetration testing, risk management, communicating and advising clients, writing reports on findings and advising on system changes for better security. Security requires strong technical skills to understand the foundations and potential vulnerabilities of systems, as well as strong risk management, communication and negotiation skills to work with clients convincing them of the nature and necessity of security systems they need to implement.</p>
				<p><b>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</b></p>
				<p>As a security consultant Edward largely deals with Executives to provide advice and guidance (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer), project managers and directors for individual projects, and internal security staff regarding security frameworks and testing regimes. He works with both IT and the business to advise them on the importance of security and systems they should establish. He also works with technical staff around fixes and changes that need to be applied to software/hardware networks. </p>
					<p><b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b></p>
					<p>As a consultant a lot of time is spent with client management providing advice and guidance, or at the base office accessing, hacking and testing client systems remotely. </p>
						<p><b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b></p>
						<p>The most challenging aspects of security are building and maintaining a comprehensive knowledge of the latest technology and techniques, and convincing clients who may not yet have experienced any security incidents of the value of investing time and money in setting up and maintaining security systems and testing regimes. Security professionals deal with a shortage of skilled resources as security requires significant experience in other areas and there is limited appetite for investing time to train lesser skilled professionals.</p>

							<p>Michelle: We are doing this course at RMIT and we wanted to talk to someone to tell us what it is like beyond study, what it is like really being out there doing what you do.<br>
								Edward: Ask me anything<br>
								M: We have a couple of aspiring security people here so we thought it would be great having you along tonight.<br>
								James: It is really great that you are here tonight we are very grateful.<br>
								M: James, Security is one of your interests isn’t it? James and Rebecca.<br>
								J: Just from different sorts of angles. Rebecca what is your interest?<br>
								Rebecca: I’m only just starting to think about it, but it’s a path I want to follow.<br>
								E: It is a very interesting field – a very wide field as well. In the way that security is specialised, but then it can also go anywhere, from auditing, strategy, architecture, design, to hands on hacking – ethical hacking – into operations, applications and networking. Security covers the entire technology stack so in a way it is very broad.<br>
								M: Ed certainly convinced me in IT projects – I had previously thought security was the annoying thing on the side but Ed persuaded me that it is absolutely critical.<br>
								J: My main thing is I am looking at getting into red teams and that sort of thing – like the white hat ethical hacking.  I have been looking at Linux and that sort of thing.  I have done security courses and I am planning on doing risk management as well. I have got some friends who work in private security and contacts in cybersecurity but I was wondering if there are any sort of basics you would recommend as a starting point.<br>
								E: Yes, there are quite a lot. Offensive security happens to be the field that I specialise in. Before this I was doing everything in security at the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank went through a massive expansion in security - we grew from 12 to over 25 people. Back then I took leadership of the security assessments team, then led the pen test team at the Commonwealth Bank. So offensive security is what I have been doing for the last 7 years.  It has a lot of engagement. It’s a field that is quite different to everything else – I call it technical security. The core of it is not so different to computer science.  I always say to people who want to join the field and become a hacker – you won’t be trying to hack your girlfriend’s Facebook or your neighbours’ WIFI. It’s really no different to any field in computer science – its always back to the basics. Forget about trying to be cool, it is nothing like wearing a dark hoodie or sitting in a dark corner. It is about the basics, knowing about the networking stack, how your OS and programming works, your programming languages, how networking protocols work, and how applications are deployed and tested, developed and designed. Those are the key parts that would be involved.  So it is all back to the basics. If you don’t know how the protocols work you would not know exactly how to hack them. You might be able to pick up a thing or two, or tricks and tools on the internet, but if you use them without understanding the underlying protocols, how they work and why they are vulnerable in the first place you are just scripting – running the tool and hoping for the best. So a real hacker knows about how things come across. In a SQL injection you need to understand how SQL is constructed and how you run it so that you will be able to see how it is constructed, how the web server is put together to exploit it. So if you want to join and be a red teamer or be like myself – I am actually pretty rusty being red team.  Red team is when you are given an objective – come hack my organisation – I will only give you my company info – your objective is to gain domain admin access or steal the CEO’s email – you can use phishing, emap machine, malware, drop a USB in the lobby. Once you get in you would try to be persistent to establish a backdoor to get in as much as you want. You stay low and slow and try to learn about the organisation. You would spend time learning about the internal operations, how the network works, try to escalate your access and privileges a step at a time until you eventually reach your goal. Sometimes this might all be done before lunchtime – there are always the stories in the industry – I have done it once myself. But sometimes it may take months to do that. So some red teaming is different to when we generalists pen test. Some projects put up a new site – let’s go do a pen test on that.  It’s a bit different. Red teaming is a bit like a lot of pen testers dream of, they get a lot of freedom and a lot of time.  A lot of our engagements are quite tight – you have 5 or 10 days to hack the site.  You can only work under the URL so the scope is a lot more restricted – no social engineering – no ringing the help desk saying you are the CEO and you want the password. It is technical and ethical hacking.<br>
								J: You manage to acquire languages – I am learning java at the moment and I know html, but what would you recommend next? Python?<br>
								E: Python is a must have for ethical hacking because there are so many scripts written in python and it lets you hack things quickly. I started off as a java developer 15 years ago – back when it was wonderful. That was a long time ago. Java is great to teach you enterprise applications because that is what it is meant for. It is not great to write a hacking script as it would take forever to get anywhere. Java is good, it teaches a lot of good things about programming how to write proper code, about object-oriented and good things. Python is not a great first language to learn – it is quite messy, a lot of freedom, you do whatever you want. We used to say Python teaches you bad habits. Next thing to get onto would be either C or bash. C is the grandfather of all languages. You learn basics about programming and how things work. You understand why so many exploits are possible because of the deficiencies and things programmers might miss in C – memory management.  A lot of low level code like OS code is written in C. Once you jump in the box and want admin access and to develop your own exploits, you need to know C. You get to understand that low level. Why do you have memory, OS, paging. All these things help you understand how software development works. Next would be Bash – it is good because it is Linux. A lot of servers are deployed and built on Linux. So knowing this helps make you faster to learn the tools, jump into boxes, it is an essential thing for you to know about. It’s a very broad topic. <br>
								M: What I have seen in security in my experience is that often clients are quite reluctant and resistant to some of the security work. They think of it as more of a blocker rather than something they should be really valuing.  How do you work with clients to get around that?<br>
								E: We hack them – we just hack them! It can be a very difficult conversation. Security it cannot be driven from bottom up.  It needs to be driven from top down. It doesn’t matter if you have the best security people and a lot of resources, if the top doesn’t care about security nothing is going to happen. A very good example would be the Equifax breach which happened 3 years ago.  They are the world’s biggest credit assessing company and they had a massive breach. Like 2 billion records were lost – massive - the biggest breach in the industry. The problem was they put out a patchy website. They didn’t patch it. There was a very well known vulnerability that was announced.  The actual hacking was made public as well. For some reason Equifax did nothing about it and three months later they got hacked. The hackers got in, got deeper and deeper in the organisation, eventually reached the juicy bits. So then there was a huge investigation – there is a report worth reading online, it tells you how and what went wrong in their organisation that ultimately led to this.  It was not just someone forgetting to patch for 3 months. A lot of things happened. One major cause was, in a modern organisation structure the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) - the guy who is ultimately responsible for day to day security in the organisation - in a modern structure they should be reporting ideally to the CEO. Or sometimes the CIO in many organisations, but ideally to the CEO so there is no conflict of interest with the CIO. But in Equifax a few years before the incident, the CISO was reporting to the CIO but they had a personal conflict to the point where the board decided to move the CISO position to report to the legal counsel. Just let that sink in – the legal counsel. The legal counsel only had a monthly meeting with the CEO and security was just one item. So there is a lot of blame about the CISO only having a music degree. She took a lot of the blame. Ultimately she resigned – the CIO and the CEO also resigned over this incident. A major cause was there was not enough attention about how important security is. It doesn’t matter how good you are – they security manager got a lot of blame for not patching. There were a lot of reviews and security consultants. There were action items but they didn’t go anywhere.<br>

M: Have you noticed, there have been some really big popular culture security breaches in recent years things like the Ashley Madison breach.  Has that kind of popular awareness, has that influenced people’s general awareness of security very much?<br>

E: I think so. Security breaches always have a spotlight in the media. Whenever there is a major breach it is all over the news.  I think there are a few reasons why security doesn’t get the attention it needs.  Security resources are pretty scarce. The IT boom, and the nature of being a security expert is you need a really solid wide foundation before you become a security expert.  As an industry we seem to be quite reluctant to train people from other areas – do you have prior security experience? No – well get out. So there are a lack of resources. There are also companies who still have this idea it has never happened to me in the last 10 years so why would it happen now? They don’t believe it until something hits. We see a lot of projects where until the last minute no one thinks about security. Until there is a breach no one thinks about security. It is at the bottom of the list until something hits, then it is at the top.<br>

Anna: Now there are so many articles about data breaches do you think corporations are taking it more seriously? Creating more jobs?<br>

E: Definitely. There is already a shortage. The Australian government has recently thrown 500 million into the public sector for cybersecurity. There is a talent shortage. It is getting a bit of attention, but it is still yet to spread.  Government and banking have a strong awareness and they put in a lot of investment, health as well, but when you look at other industries like retail and industry, building the security message needs to spread to those areas. Now hackers don’t care so much about transferring money from banks.   They care can I get access to your juicy stuff, lock it up or steal it, then get ransom for it. That is the main way of operation – how they work now.  In the old days, like 3 years ago, ransomware was all about sending out emails and malware and see if someone clicks on it then ransomware will unleash to lock up random desktops and charge $5 ransom. But now they send someone to hack manually into the organisation, find the juicy bits, steal it and charge big ransom to get their data back. And it is not about locking up your data, it is about threatening to publish it. That is big money. If I was in Romania or somewhere else in Eastern Europe with lax laws about extradition and charges for these crimes – you could assemble a hacker team and get millions of dollars for a relatively low risk scam.<br>

J: Do most people pay the ransom? There was a case with Toll Shipping where they refused and they had to go back to their paper records to carry on their business. Like going back to the 80s. But they refused to pay.  I imagine they would have lost a lot of customers losing their competitive edge against others like StarTrack. They were crippled.<br>

M: I think reputation is one of the most valuable things that companies lose through some of these breaches. Tell us Ed how much in your typical day what sort of people do you come into contact with  people in your own firm, or customers? What is it like?<br>

E: Being consultants I work with my own clients. Even in my previous jobs in security it seems to always work in a consulting model. There are a lot of projects and people come to you for a short period to review their design or do pen testing or whatnot. In this part of security we consult with projects – with PMs, CEOs, CIOs, Program directors, architects - a lot of people who are driving the project ahead. That is just in my field. Other parts of security, eg security operations you would probably be working with understanding the incoming alerts, logs, etc always trying to find the next threat.<br>

M: You talk about pen testing – do you have long term relationships with clients, or does it tend to be project based?<br>

E: Both, we have clients who just build a site, get it done, ship it out. Then there are clients who want regular testing – it really varies depending on the client’s history, how much budget they have planned, how much complexity and change they go through in their solutions.<br>

M: When someone is doing a project, at what stage would you start talking to someone like you and bringing you in?<br>

E: We usually get involved a bit late in the cycle. At the end or during implementation when the PM identifies they should do a pen test – we need to find someone. They wait til their design is finalised. In pen testing that is often quite late in the cycle.<br>

M: So we wouldn’t bring you in at design stage?<br>

E: Ideally you probably want to, but that is not the normal way it goes.  As much as we would love to. If you could it is always good to bring in a pen tester, someone who has technical hacking capability at the very beginning it would be very useful.  We think how would we hack the solution you are designing.  We can help people to build stronger systems.<br>

M: What non-technical skills are really valuable in security?<br>

E: It is part science and part art. Ultimately it is about risk management. You need to be able to get clients to understand there is nothing certain about it.  We cannot make 100% guarantees and statements about risk and safety. It is all about how likely/unlikely and the clients risk appetite. Clients might not trust you or think that a less secure way is better.  You need to be tactful talking about security. In our role we are never the enforcer, we never go in and tell people what they must do with definite consequences.  We go in and say we strongly advise you do this because of this possible consequence.  You need to say it in a way that is meaningful to the business people – people could steal your database, or destroy it – that is the risk. You have to explain the impact.<br>

M: One of the biggest things we have seen in some of the security news like Playstation and Ashley Madison – they literally just stole people’s information.<br>

E: Exactly – we would like to say security is simple and basic. A lot of major hacks we see are because someone left a key easy to find. When you look at how they got in, it wasn’t complicated. But the majority of the data breaches are because of simple hacks. The technical bit is simple, but not the fix, the processes and people you need in place – that can be complex. As you scale bigger the amount of effort and resources you need gets much bigger. When it gets too difficult it can just get pushed aside. How do you influence people to think it is important. This is why security must be pushed from the top down.<br>

J: It really parallels with standard non-IT security. My mentor works in private security and risk management and so much is similar. You need to remove hazards to mitigate risk.<br>

M: I get scared about the little physical things you cannot guard against – I mean usb keys are a popular giveaway these days people hand them out like lollies. And you see a usb sitting on your desk and you have owned so many different ones so you just pick it up assume its one of yours and just stick it in your computer and bang.<br>

E: It’s not so much just inserting the USB - most people have protection against that, unless you have a really old computer. The trick of it is when people open a file on there. You name it staff salaries or something to entice people like that – curiosity gets the best of people. When they open it that’s when something bad happens.<br>

M: So working with Planit do you find it easy or difficult to get security staff? Are companies hiring the right kind of people?<br>

E: It can be quite difficult to find good staff – they are pretty hard to find in the market. There is a lack of good pen testing resources.<br>

A: What is the typical path to a job in cybersecurity? Is there a typical path?<br>

E: I am not sure if there is a typical one.<br>

A: What was your path?<br>

E: I started as a software developer. I was working with a company in a research development lab.  I was interested in how you get into secret stuff.  We were implementing gateways and public infrastructure.  We will get you working on those projects.  It is probably the same for a lot of people. It is rare for a graduate to get into security – I don’t actually recommend it. You should get some good working experience in some other areas first. You need to know how to build and configure the stuff before you try to break it. That is how a lot of people get into security – they are working in a role and then an opportunity opens up and you can jump into a junior position.<br>

A: It sounds like you need to be specialised in a lot of things before you move to security.<br>

E: Yes, offensive security is probably the easiest way to jump into security – get some pen testing certificates. Master them and run some projects and demonstrate to potential employers that you can hack and you can become a pen tester. It doesn’t require as much prior experience and it’s easier to demonstrate.<br>

J: I was really inspired by the movie Sneakers in the 90s. I would like to learn just as much about offensive and defensive. So I guess I need to learn a lot like C and other things.<br>

M: There has been a lot of security software developed – like some that can show you everything that is plugged into your network and every data transfer.  Have you found that new developments in hardware and software have really had an impact on security?<br>

E: Like security-centric tools. There are constantly new tools being developed – tools is one area of security. Last time I checked there were about 600 different vendors offering tools. Checking networks, automatic blocking and automatic firewalls. That’s only the commercial ones. Then there are still the open source ones – people developing new scripts and new ways of checking exploits – it never stops.<br>

M: I suppose that is good – as things get more sophisticated you can concentrate on the new stuff and use tools for some of the old stuff.<br>

E: You always need to be updating. We have tools of trade and we always go o line looking for scripts to connect to different software.<br>

M: I imagine there is a pretty steep and constant learning curve in security to stay up to date.<br>

E: Yes that is one of the good things – you always get new technology to play with. We have to research what it does and what kind of cracks there could be. There are a lot of smart people in the industry and that is what they do – research and learning.  You don’t have to be a security person to do security – a lot are software engineers with profound understanding of the program so they know how to hack it.<br>

J: Yes they would know where the cracks in the foundation are.<br>

E: In our roles we are always looking for known holes and we look for how to exploit them.  Researchers always find new ones. It is just like you have doctors who are practitioners and there are doctors who are researchers for new diseases and cures.<br>

M: How much should I genuinely worry about reusing my passwords.<br>

E: You should be very, very worried.  That cannot be a thing now because of all the leaks that go on.  You cannot use the same passwords. Use a password manager. They are simple to install – use a commercial version, an offline version, a cloud version. Anything is better.<br>

M: With a password manager isn’t that worse – all my passwords are in one place. If someone gets into that they will have all my passwords.<br>

E: It is about managing risk. If you put them all in cloud and a SAAS password manager then yes.  How much do you trust the SAAS provider. Make sure your passwords are stored encrypted. So you are the only person who knows how to unencrypt them.  Maybe you want to keep some of your valuable passwords somewhere else – bank, Facebook, google and apple passwords.  There are plenty of password managers online. Our job as security professionals is to try to help you understand the risk you are facing. That is our job to make you understand that. But once they understand, how they want to take it from there is up to them.<br>

J: What is the best way to protect your devices?<br>

E: Keep your system up to date.  Keep your software up to date. Install all patches. Use complex passwords. Don’t click on random websites or download random files. If you are technical enough use a non-admin account for your day to day browsing. These are easy to do. Unless you are my grandfather!<br></p>
