				<h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2><br>
				<p>Cryptocurrency is a decentralised digital currency that runs on blockchain technology. Much like cash, it facilitates peer-to-peer transactions, without the requirement of a central financial institute to oversee the transaction, or for the two parties to even know or trust the other. (Reserve Bank of Australia 2020).<br>

Cryptocurrency essentially takes out the need for middleman in financial transactions (banking and financial institutes in this instance), which results in a few notable advantages for users:<br>
- Much lower or no transactional fees due to the transaction being peer-to-peer;<br>
- The time it takes to complete a transaction with an overseas entity is much faster compared to traditional means of sending currency; <br>
- Transactions are very unlikely to be impacted by fraudulent activity and forgery due to the cryptography technology utilised, which is secured by a series of complex coding and mathematical equations.<br></p>

<p>To get started, a user requires a digital wallet to store and use cryptocurrencies. Much like cash, if a user loses or forgets the access ‘key’ to their wallet, it is extremely difficult to recover. Although the cryptocurrency is still in existence, the ownership of this currency would ultimately be lost.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are appealing to certain users due to the technology being able to provide a level of anonymity or pseudonymity. Although all transactions are recorded and verified on a public ledger, there is no name or identity verification required to open an account or to complete a transaction. Personal information cannot be traced back from a transaction. Although it is not as anonymous as trading cash, it is the next closest thing, and has the advantage of a global reach. Due to this factor, levels of illegal activity have been completed via cryptocurrency transfers. However, criminal activity is evident in all forms of transactions, so this is not an issue exclusive to cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Unlike fiat currency, the use and trade of cryptocurrency is largely for investment purposes, rather than treated in the same method as an everyday expenditure. “The fascination with these currencies appears to have been more speculative (buying cryptocurrencies to make a profit) than related to their use as a new and unique system for making payments” (Reserve Bank of Australia 2020, page 1). Cryptocurrency would have to be adapted to make it easier to complete everyday payments if it expects to be widely adopted into our society.</p>

<p>Whilst the value of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, doesn’t have any legislated or intrinsic value, the value of it is purely driven by the value that the market perceives it to be. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, limit their supply of Bitcoins to the amount of 21 million coins. (Bitcon 2020) As supply of these coins starts to diminish (if it ever gets to that stage), the laws of supply and demand would dictate that the value would inherently rise with demand.</p>

<p>If cryptocurrencies continue with its rapid growth, early proponents of cryptocurrencies forecast that we could see Cryptocurrencies begin to replace fiat currencies and become a primary global currency (Senner & Sornette 2018).</p>

<p>The next few years will be critical in determining whether cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, will become a prevalent and valid way of accepting payment. The wider the speed and depth of the adoption between now and then, the more likely that the value of these currencies will stabilise, and have continuous growth. This technology would also disrupt stable institutions such as financial services, as people start to move away from fiat currency. However it is likely the financial banking services already have strategies in place should this happen and potentially offer their own form of cryptocurrency services or a digital currency.</p>

<p>The rise of cryptocurrencies is already impacting us locally, with the Reserve Bank of Australia being compelled by blockchain developers to preemptively start experimenting with digital currency technologies much more considerably, rather than be bystanders to its growth. The Financial Review has reported that global banks such as The Bank of Canada, Monetary Authority of Singapore and Riksbank of Sweden have already begun to conduct testing around digital versions of their fiat currencies (Eyers 2017). This experiment would perhaps be given little to no consideration had cryptocurrency not been as prolific as it has.</p>

<p>The use of cryptocurrency is not currently being utilised by myself, however I will be continuing to monitor its rise or fall in popularity, as it is a technology that interests me and has the potential to change elements of my life.</p>

<p>On a broader scale, if cryptocurrency became more widely accepted as an alternative to conventional currencies and could manage transactions of personal small scale everyday spend, this would definitely make me consider adopting. An immediate benefit that I can see is the ease this global currency could bring to myself on international travel if it were more widely accepted. I wouldn’t have to exchange currencies at the airport again, or carry around cash which always made me feel a level of discomfort. Also the security that this type of technology brings would give me a greater sense of comfort when transacting online, sending money internationally to friends and family for instance. I can see numerous benefits to cryptocurrency that could improve my everyday life.</p>

<p>For cryptocurrency to become this level of prevalence in our lives, a lot of technological factors would have to improve. Currently as it stands, cryptocurrencies are being used primarily as part of investment portfolios rather than for regular payments. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with the current largest user base on the market, would not be able to cope at its current levels with an increase in volume of transactions. This is due to the complexity of its transactional processing capabilities, which is both a negative and a positive in its case, being both time consuming and limited in resources (Reserve Bank of Australia 2020).</p>

<p>Like with any new technology, there will be a slow transition, making small changes to our everyday habits, or perhaps even changing or alleviating ourselves of ties to any financial institutions. But like with any new technology, the opportunities and impact that this could bring to our lives could be monumental.
