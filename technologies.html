					<h2>IT Technologies</h2>
					<span class="byline">We explore four exciting developments in the IT world, the areas that really excite us!<br> We look more indepth into Cybersecurity, Cryptocurrencies,
Robots and Raspberry Pi's in our report.</span>
				</div>
				<h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2><br>
				<p>Cryptocurrency is a decentralised digital currency that runs on blockchain technology. Much like cash, it facilitates peer-to-peer transactions, without the requirement of a central financial institute to oversee the transaction, or for the two parties to even know or trust the other. (Reserve Bank of Australia 2020).<br>

Cryptocurrency essentially takes out the need for middleman in financial transactions (banking and financial institutes in this instance), which results in a few notable advantages for users:<br>
- Much lower or no transactional fees due to the transaction being peer-to-peer;<br>
- The time it takes to complete a transaction with an overseas entity is much faster compared to traditional means of sending currency; <br>
- Transactions are very unlikely to be impacted by fraudulent activity and forgery due to the cryptography technology utilised, which is secured by a series of complex coding and mathematical equations.<br></p>
<span id="dots">...</span><br><span id="more">
<p>To get started, a user requires a digital wallet to store and use cryptocurrencies. Much like cash, if a user loses or forgets the access ‘key’ to their wallet, it is extremely difficult to recover. Although the cryptocurrency is still in existence, the ownership of this currency would ultimately be lost.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are appealing to certain users due to the technology being able to provide a level of anonymity or pseudonymity. Although all transactions are recorded and verified on a public ledger, there is no name or identity verification required to open an account or to complete a transaction. Personal information cannot be traced back from a transaction. Although it is not as anonymous as trading cash, it is the next closest thing, and has the advantage of a global reach. Due to this factor, levels of illegal activity have been completed via cryptocurrency transfers. However, criminal activity is evident in all forms of transactions, so this is not an issue exclusive to cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Unlike fiat currency, the use and trade of cryptocurrency is largely for investment purposes, rather than treated in the same method as an everyday expenditure. “The fascination with these currencies appears to have been more speculative (buying cryptocurrencies to make a profit) than related to their use as a new and unique system for making payments” (Reserve Bank of Australia 2020, page 1). Cryptocurrency would have to be adapted to make it easier to complete everyday payments if it expects to be widely adopted into our society.</p>

<p>Whilst the value of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, doesn’t have any legislated or intrinsic value, the value of it is purely driven by the value that the market perceives it to be. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, limit their supply of Bitcoins to the amount of 21 million coins. (Bitcon 2020) As supply of these coins starts to diminish (if it ever gets to that stage), the laws of supply and demand would dictate that the value would inherently rise with demand.</p>

<p>If cryptocurrencies continue with its rapid growth, early proponents of cryptocurrencies forecast that we could see Cryptocurrencies begin to replace fiat currencies and become a primary global currency (Senner & Sornette 2018).</p>

<p>The next few years will be critical in determining whether cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, will become a prevalent and valid way of accepting payment. The wider the speed and depth of the adoption between now and then, the more likely that the value of these currencies will stabilise, and have continuous growth. This technology would also disrupt stable institutions such as financial services, as people start to move away from fiat currency. However it is likely the financial banking services already have strategies in place should this happen and potentially offer their own form of cryptocurrency services or a digital currency.</p>

<p>The rise of cryptocurrencies is already impacting us locally, with the Reserve Bank of Australia being compelled by blockchain developers to preemptively start experimenting with digital currency technologies much more considerably, rather than be bystanders to its growth. The Financial Review has reported that global banks such as The Bank of Canada, Monetary Authority of Singapore and Riksbank of Sweden have already begun to conduct testing around digital versions of their fiat currencies (Eyers 2017). This experiment would perhaps be given little to no consideration had cryptocurrency not been as prolific as it has.</p>

<p>The use of cryptocurrency is not currently being utilised by myself, however I will be continuing to monitor its rise or fall in popularity, as it is a technology that interests me and has the potential to change elements of my life.</p>

<p>On a broader scale, if cryptocurrency became more widely accepted as an alternative to conventional currencies and could manage transactions of personal small scale everyday spend, this would definitely make me consider adopting. An immediate benefit that I can see is the ease this global currency could bring to myself on international travel if it were more widely accepted. I wouldn’t have to exchange currencies at the airport again, or carry around cash which always made me feel a level of discomfort. Also the security that this type of technology brings would give me a greater sense of comfort when transacting online, sending money internationally to friends and family for instance. I can see numerous benefits to cryptocurrency that could improve my everyday life.</p>

<p>For cryptocurrency to become this level of prevalence in our lives, a lot of technological factors would have to improve. Currently as it stands, cryptocurrencies are being used primarily as part of investment portfolios rather than for regular payments. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency with the current largest user base on the market, would not be able to cope at its current levels with an increase in volume of transactions. This is due to the complexity of its transactional processing capabilities, which is both a negative and a positive in its case, being both time consuming and limited in resources (Reserve Bank of Australia 2020).</p>

<p>Like with any new technology, there will be a slow transition, making small changes to our everyday habits, or perhaps even changing or alleviating ourselves of ties to any financial institutions. But like with any new technology, the opportunities and impact that this could bring to our lives could be monumental.

<h2>Cybersecurity</h2><br>
<p>There continues to be an exponential growth in the virtualisation of our society through the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT). As the demand for internet-based resources increases, so too does the challenge to protect private and professional hardware, software, and data. Cybersecurity professionals rely on sophisticated technology and are shifting towards detection methods to prevent cyber-attacks. It is important to note that even the most efficient technologies will not prevent human error, added measures must be taken to educate and bring awareness to users as well.</p>

<p>The most promising Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology associated with cybersecurity today is Deep Learning (DL), a subset of Machine Learning (ML). This is an example of technology making an impact in cybersecurity, ‘it is the endeavour to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines’ (Built In, 2020). ‘Today, nearly all software in every industry – especially in security – use at least some form of AI’ (Caspi, 2020). Deep Learning refers to technology that acts to mimic the human brain using neural networks. Inspired by biological neural networks these systems use layers programmed to perform specific tasks, like neurons. Unlike traditional machine learning, ‘deep learning is capable of training directly on raw data without the need for feature extraction.’ (Caspi, 2020). </p>
<span id="dots2">...</span><br><span id="more2">
<p>DL can be separated into two categories; supervised and unsupervised systems, the main difference being the latter requires less human training for outputs, because it relies on patterns to learn more independently. Both methods require large data sets and computational power (Raicea, 2020). Most cybersecurity mechanisms today are supervised systems and the more advanced unsupervised DL mechanisms ‘are still in an emerging phase and experimentation’ (Kompella, 2020). AI that perfectly simulates the human brain, independently of the human component does not yet exist. </p>
<p>DL uses complex algorithms and architectures, and its capabilities make it applicable in all facets of Information Technology (IT) and all industries. DL is superior to traditional ML and enhances Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) by providing real-time detection and prevention. A DL system can learn using the data it is subjected to and recognise how a system behaves. This ability enables it to detect Malware threats that are not obvious to human analysts, by identifying behaviours that are not consistent with usual behaviour patterns. This ability to recognise behaviour can be describe by User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA). This technology uses sophisticated techniques to protect a system and detect any threats internally and externally of a network (Infocyte, 2020). AI is also used in biometrics that we are familiar with through our personal device security options.</p>
<p>The shift from Ml towards DL is inevitable, recent statistics state that cybersecurity currently consists of only ‘2% deep learning, 98% traditional machine learning’ (Ismail, 2020). The future of DL in cybersecurity is likely to be inspired by cyber threat trends such as phishing scams, deepfakes, ransomware and data leaks to name a few. Attackers and defenders alike will benefit from this technology, and so it is important to continue developing DL defence mechanisms. This will empower systems to anticipate the sophistication of these attacks and make informed developments. ‘Future development of deep learning technologies will continue to advance its usefulness for cybersecurity’ (Samsung Catalyst, 2020). Artificial neural networks make DL systems the advanced mechanisms they are and fine tuning these will have a huge impact on this technology. </p>
<p>AI is important in cybersecurity because of its the potential to automate these preventative measures (Kompella, 2020), and achieve analysis at speeds and quantities unlike the human component. The evolution of technology is occurring at unprecedented rates and the impact of this development, particularly in security, will depend on the creativity of attackers and the potential of cybersecurity developers to anticipate future attacks. DL continues to focus on programming systems that can detect anomalies that are bypass algorithms and non-explicit programming.</p>
<p>Recent Australian statistics show that ‘Attacks on IoT devices tripled in the first half of 2019’ (Fruhlinger, 2020). Now more than ever, it is necessary to employ systems that can detect and prevent threats that can compete with the rate at which this occurs. Artificial Intelligence: supervised or unsupervised, applications rely on historical data to apply logic, and the more data and activity that these systems can interpret, the more ‘intelligently’ they are able to perform. Time and greater volumes of relevant data can only improve the capabilities of this technology. </p>
<p>IoT brings security threats into our physical life as trends of wearable technology become increasingly popular and through the prevalence of diverse personal and professional platforms available to users (Hitechies Enterprise Solutions, 2020). Cybersecurity implications can affect numerous industries and thus likely to affect essentially anyone who lends their information to an organisation or even platform. </p>
<p>Cybersecurity should be at the forefront of our concern. Rare is the individual that does not encounter the use of internet-connected technology in a day, whether it be in a personal or professional sense. It is easy to forget that we are also connected to organisations like government facilities that also depend on technology to store our more sensitive data. DL applications in cybersecurity will have an impact on all personal and professional networks as cyber threats become more sophisticated and widespread. </p>
<p>The developments of DL are likely to go unnoticed on the surface, however as an individual pursuing a career in cybersecurity the potential of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning is of great interest to me. This technology has a ubiquitous presence across numerous industries and IT facets, indicating its importance in the future of our Information Age. DL will create a benchmark for personal and professional security systems. </p>
<p>Amongst my friends and family, the biggest impact will be the level of security of communication devices as well as online social media and communication applications. An example of a common cyber threat mentioned earlier, is phishing scams; hackers aim to access personal information through intriguing messages and usually succeed through human curiosity with costly consequences for victims. DL has the potential to detect these threats through pattern recognition and address them in real-time before any human errors occur, again going unnoticed. Deep learning technologies are making an impact in AI and likely already impact our daily lives beyond cybersecurity as our interest in smarter technology develops. </p>

	<h2>Raspberry Pi and other small computers</h2><br>
	<p>Small computing devices, also known as single board microcontrollers, have been becoming more and more popular and affordable over the last 20 years (Wikipedia- Single-board microcontroller 2020). It is now cheap and simple for manufactures to design circuit boards for microcontrollers. Running OS’s (operating system) on these devises is also cheaper thanks to open source software.</p>

<p>Manufactures of single board microcontrollers are designing their boards to include as many features as possible. Depending on your requirement, a vast array of boards now come with Gigabit Ethernet ports, USB 2.0 & 3.0 Hosts, HDMI 1.4a for display(s), Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0. Some good examples of small computing boards, without going into mobile computing are (Adrian Kingsley-Hughes 2020):</p>
<span id="dots3">...</span><br><span id="more3">
  <ul.style3>
  <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Odroid XU4</li>
<li>UDOO Bolt V8</li>
<li>NanoPi NEO4</li>
<li>UDOO x86 II ULTRA</li>
<li>Arduino</li>
</ul.style3><br>

	<p>With this laid out, and access to this tech by the vast majorities, we can see simple projects being developed daily. Examples include Media Centre, Local Cloud Server, Home Automation, VPN Server, Garden Watering System, Print Server, Retro Gaming Console, Weather Station, LED Controller, Arduino Mega Chess, Basic Earthquake Detector, Garage Door Opener and many more (Ankush Das 2020). Access to a network of repositories, which in a nutshell is a storage location from where your chosen system can retrieve, download and install applications and OS updates, developers can publish and share code for their work. Each repository is hosted on its own remote server containing a collection of software available to users. Users can have a multitude of repositories installed from a variety of sources. </p>
	<p>Single board microcontrollers are available in a vast selection of sizes and complexities. Depending on you project or idea is to which device you use. For example, A simple garden watering system that has a timer and turns taps on and off, Arduino would be perfect. However, if you add further complexities like the ability to log the frequency of watering, remote access & ability to manually override and close the side gate at the same time, Raspberry Pi would be better suited (IoT Industrial 2020).</p>
	<p>Looking forward it is safe to say that single board microcontrollers are gaining popularity in the use of internet-connected smart devices, also known as Internet of Thigs (IoT). With the rollout of 5G Networks Australia wide this will continue to fuel the growth of IoT devices, including devices like Raspberry Pi and Arduino. There is an estimated 30.7 billion in 2020 with the prediction of growing to 51.1 billion devices by 2023 and extending further to over 73 billion by 2025 (Statista 2020).</p>
	<p>Another point to look at is with the advancement in microprocessor power and affordability, single board microcontroller also become more powerful. This year, 2020, has shown the release of the 4GiB 1.5 GHz which is 16x faster that it’s original release in 2012. Maybe some years soon, because of hardware advancements we’ll see picture and video editing on a Raspberry Pi or Odroid XU4. While currently there is a stable version of windows for a RPI, adding additional software like the Adobe creative cloud suite (not currently available on Linux) would not be wise due the resource demand these programs require.</p>
  <p>I believe the impacts of this progressions of this technology is for the greater good. Greater connectivity in everyday items as part of the IoT spectrum means greater productivity in everyday tasks. Homemade and customizable home automation systems run by generic hardware be it Arduino with their many <a href="https://www.thegeekpub.com/wiki/list-of-arduino-sensors-and-modules/" target = blank> sensors and modules</a> or a Linux based Raspberry Pi with the many <a href="https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-hats" target=blank>HATs available</a>. The further we progress with this technology, the more careful we need to be with our security measures. Back in 2016 the world was introduced to the first “Internet of Things” malware, Mirai. This malicious malware installed on many IoT devices, still using default usernames and passwords, attacked DNS servers resulting in the inaccessibility of several well-known websites, including Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, Airbnb, Netflix and many others (Wikipedia 2020).
    <p>Looking over the last two points, in respects to a greater number of IoT’s and security concerns, I feel opens opportunities in the IT industry in many fields. Some example fields are Software Engineering and Cyber Security Specialists. With thanks to platforms like Coursera and OUA (Open Universities Australia) and the affordability of devices like RPI and Arduino, access to study, tinker and experiment in these IT fields is getting easier.  </p>
    <p>Diving a bit deeper into education, according to both Wikipedia pages for Arduino and Raspberry Pi both of these devices were originally planned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools (Wikipedia- Arduino 2020, Wikipedia- Single-board microcontroller 2020),. With more schools taking up computer studies as an elective, teaching the basic building blocks of programing on these portable inexpensive learning tools can really spark a passion in students for the IT industry. This will hopefully lead to an influx of young, brilliant ideas through all fields of our industry, not just Software Engineering and Cyber Security. </p>
    <p>This will affect many of our daily lives due to the predicted growth over the next few years. Given the easer access to hardware, software, accessories and sensors this will spur people’s imagination. The single board microcontroller’s ever evolving feature range means greater connectivity with a multitude of other devices. Further education in programing in schools on these cheap devices means the ever increasing ‘tinkering’ community’s knowledge base will keep growing. </p>
    <p>This will have quite an impact on my life personally as I (and my fellow classmates) have enrolled in RMIT’s Bachelor of Information Technology qualification. The future is filled with many possibilities in a new career in the world of IT. Be it in Systems Analyst, Network Engineer, Web Developer, Software Engineer or Support Specialist. In this first module of ‘Introduction to Information Technology’ it covers many introductory topics that will be encountered throughout our new IT careers. I believe moving forward the impact these credit card sized microcontrollers will also have on my life will take on more of an inspirational nature. When thinking about and planning small projects to execute, sometimes the idea isn’t the end result, but the journey there. The process of tinkering, researching, learning then executing (sometimes many times!) all promote inspiration to improve the previous version(s) of your code. </p>
    <p>Raspberry Pi’s, Arduino or what ever other single board microcontroller will make an impact on friends and family’s lives in more of a convenience manor. Over the coming years, and with a greater number of IoT devices (created by people like us), I think not just friends and family’s, but the general population will benefit with more time thanks to a greater number of devices doing automation tasks. That’s not to say that one of our nearest and dearest won’t get the tinkering bug and discover single board microcontrollers for themselves. </p>

		<h2>Robots</h2><br>
		<p>Robots are programmable devices that perform functions considered as technological achievements. They are gaining rapid recognition with its resemblance and ability to execute different duties. Serving to benefit and enrich tasks in several industries. Industrial robots are often used in the manufacturing and production workspaces. It is a multipurpose manipulator programmed for different applications executing a repetitive job, either stationary or semi stationary. This comprises of completion of tasks through special variable programmed motions (Harris, 2002). Undoubtedly, this industry will gain many benefits and changing phases by utilising robots in their workspace. It is believed that in the coming years, robots will work alongside humans in this field or some even say that it will replace humans as it provides accurate, quality work at efficient speed and low costs. Advancements in medical technology translate to the rise of robotic automation in the medical field.</p><span id="dots4">...</span><br><span id="more4">
      <p>While many think that the labours in manufacturing factories are the only ones in risk of having their jobs replaced by robots, this extremely intelligent innovation carries the ability to perform medical duties, hence experts predict that the future will have massive robotic presence in this workplace as medical robots perform procedures on patients (Tomlinson,  2018). Some duties include checking patients’ pulse, autonomous arms to perform delicate procedures, endoscopy improvements with flexible robots carrying out the job. While we won’t probably have a fully robotic surgeon in the next few years, this innovation might be accomplished in the future. Household or consumer robots are the most common types of robots we would see in our daily lives completing tasks with minimal efforts from our end. These robots claim to be programmed to manage household chores with its sensors, improving lifestyle and making it much easier to always have a clean environment (Thomson, 2019). These products have already become a favourite and useful invention in society, and this will only elevate from here as people become busier and opt for the choice of having robots do the work around the house, hence allowing individuals to spend that time doing something else. Some of the robotic inventions include robotic vacuum cleaners, mops, pool cleaners, lawnmowers, window cleaners and others (Forsdick, 2019). These are among the few that have already been developed but it wouldn’t be long until there are robots programmed to do every specific job in the environment. By extension robotic technologies have advanced and its artificial intelligence involvement equips it with humanlike behaviours, equivalent to senses. Most robots are composed of the same components. The sensors, the brain and the mechanical body parts (Britannica, 2020). The hearing sense comes from the use of a microphone which digitally processes sounds into electrical signal thus, modelling the way the robot responds. Smell sensors are effectively a matter of electrochemical detectors that convert smell into electrical signals conceptualized like human recognition. Understanding the perception of how the robot sees and processes vision to approach and recognise different situations might sound complicated but robotic technologies see through inserted digital cameras (Chris, 2019). However, in the context of self-controlling cars developers have proceeded to recognise options such as lidar, sonar, infrared detectors and other sensory elements as a substitute for eyes. Testing different measures with rapid advancements means developing more complicated programs. Artificial intelligence developments accelerate as robots rehearse in simulations that shows how it will respond in different situations testing its cultural, physical and physiological aspects. The evolution of robotic technology definitely has its pros and cons but, it seems that its pros outweigh the cons and will prove to be substantially beneficial in the coming generations as it may even reach a point where machines are drastically more intelligent than humans could ever be and perform tasks that could possibly be impossible for people.</p>
    	<p>Advancements in technology adversely impact robotic intelligence which fundamentally effects many industries in exponential ways. This innovation has the ability to revolutionize workforce production and the widespread adoption of this has the potential to replace human employment (Brown, 2020). It is an inevitable concept as organisations are seeing how its capabilities outweigh most human skills hence opting for it as a more beneficial option, performing tasks efficiently, accurately, with minimal or no errors and within a time frame. Serving businesses advantages with lower labour cost, fast production times and minimal mistakes means less product waste which translates to escalation of profits (Schilperoort, 2019). Rise of robotic intelligence will only begin to prove a threat to human employment but, it will serve many positive outcomes as a servant that does everything and anything from cooking to fetching things. Robots may also act as friend that will be there for you when needed as they are programmed to suit your desired needs, a robotic friend will certainly be a good friend that you will wish to have around. This development could potentially save lives, this may come across as a very strong statement however, it is true. The duty of disarming or detecting bombs can ultimately be very threatening, robots will help in the completion of these dangerous jobs being on the front lines for the general purpose of keeping peace. In forms as security robots, checking weapons, patrol areas that could be potentially harmful for humans or even as an autonomous soldier, fighting for the country and saving many lives. Artificial intelligence could also be enabled in the education field as robotic teachers. As autistic children struggle communicating with others, these robots will be specially designed to educate them providing care for their needs. However, regular classes may also be replaced with this intelligent innovation as these robots will not even forget a single detail (Staples, 2018).</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence has had remarkable growth from being seen only in science fiction to offering service in broad forms. Robots have consistently evolved and will continue to augment various industries (Goel, 2019). Not only will it significantly impact workplaces, but it will pursue in being present in our daily lives, homes and could even enrich our relationships. Robots have many potentials as they are programmed to carry out different duties, reshaping the way individuals live and immersing in their lifestyles. Robot vacuum cleaners are among the very few popular autonomous robots that have already been incorporated in homes, they are specifically designed to perform the tiresome household chore. This has certainly changed lifestyles as people do not have to take out time and efforts to achieve a clean home as this responsibility is managed without having to leave your seat. However, this is just the beginning, it is predicted that robots will continuously be seen performing different duties around the home in the coming years. Its broad array of traits and functions will serve benefits to everyone from kids to adults. As parents are becoming busier with work and having less time to spend with their child, especially in studies (Elamin, 2018). This is where social robots will intervene. These robots might prove to be artificial buddies for your child, consciously changing the future of parenting while performing many tasks in raising a child (The Medical Futurist 2017). This might include, changing nappies, helping with schoolwork, revising what your child has learnt that day, feeding, packing their lunch, monitoring their health. These are (Worth, 2016) among the few responsibilities that could be controlled by robots. Fuelled with increasing robotic technologies, robots can also act as companions for the elderly, thus, providing their medication on time, reminding them of appointments and things to do, sourcing entertainment and connecting them with their relatives. As advancements are substantially progressing each year it seems that Incorporating robots will Radically transform lifestyles and reshape the way families spend time and do things.  </p>
